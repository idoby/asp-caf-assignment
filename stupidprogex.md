# CAF Explained Like I'm 8

Imagine you have a giant art folder at home. Every time you draw something new, you want to save it without losing the old drawings. CAF is like a magic librarian that keeps every version of every drawing forever so you can always rewind and see what changed.

- **Python is the friendly librarian.** It talks to you, understands the words you type (`caf init`, `caf commit`), and tells you what happened in normal sentences. Python is great at conversations, so it runs the command-line tool you interact with.
- **C++ is the super-fast robot helper.** When the librarian needs to copy, compare, or lock files quickly, it asks the robot. C++ is faster at heavy lifting, so it handles hashing and safe storage so nothing gets mixed up.
- **The two work together.** Python listens to you and decides what needs to happen; C++ actually moves the boxes of drawings around at lightning speed. They share notes through a small bridge so they always agree on what is stored.
- **Why bother?** Because this project teaches how real tools like Git remember history. You learn how commands, storage, and safety checks all fit together just like a team of helpers keeping your art collection tidy.

So when you run CAF, think of typing instructions to a polite librarian who calls in a speedy robot friend. Together they make sure your creations are saved, labeled, and ready to show off whenever you want.
